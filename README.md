# Lessy 
	Is Less-Touch reborn to be more functional and fast and less redundant

#Install 
	' npm install lessy '

#Example
	"
		var lessy = require('lessy');
		//get a lessy object, it requires two arguments
			-	output : where you wish your generated css files to be saved
			- imports : where you keep your other less files( usually in the same as the less folder,if u seprate your less files though(note thats a bad idea generally)),supply the directory path so it can handle less @imports directives

		var compiler = lessy('./css','./less');
		//to watch a single file
		compiler.sync('./less/style.less');
		//supply a second arguments if u wish to rename the file
		compiler.sync('./less/style.less','styledup.css');
		//to watch a directory
		compiler.syncDir('./less');
		//then startup your compiler
		compiler.bootup();
	"
# Features
	- capable of watching only a single file
	- capable of dealing with @import directives by requiring you to specify your location for your less files
	- capable of watching a directory and updating itself with the lists of files added
	- a better time based loop
